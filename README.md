## About
Ever wonder where your favourite cricket team stands in their competition? Have you ever tried frantically calculating the seemingly endless match possibilities to determine how they could advance? Well, worry no more!

Sport Sim is a cricket simulator where fans of the ICC World Test Championship, the Indian Premier League, and the Big Bash League can  effortlessly simulate matches and view real-time standings, all without the hassle of manual calculations.

For the ICC World Test Championship, users can select the result of each upcoming match in the current 2023-2025 edition, and view the resulting points table which automatically updates in real time. Dual multi-select search makes finding matches by teams and venues a lot simpler. To take further advantage, users can also reset or randomly simulate selected matches for advanced control over their simulation. Limited to the World Test Championship, users can also take into consideration deduction points for any potential slow overrates. 

Fans of other T20 franchise cricket leagues, such as the IPL and BBL, can enjoy the same set of features, with the additional capability of simulating the match scorecard. Users can control the Net Run Rate and simultaneously view all changes in a more detailed points table.
